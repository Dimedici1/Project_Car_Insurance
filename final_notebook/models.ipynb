    "# Comparative Analysis of Machine Learning Models \n",
    "\n",
    "As a risk department of an insurance company, we understand the importance of building robust predictive models to accurately assess the likelihood of claims for various insurance products. In our quest to build a better model for predicting car insurance claims within the first 6 months of insurance, we have explored multiple machine learning algorithms and techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook presents a detailed analysis of the different models we have tried, including their strengths and weaknesses, and how they compare to our baseline model. We have experimented with various algorithms such as decision trees, random forests, logistic regression, and support vector machines, among others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our aim is to identify the best-performing model that can help us make more accurate predictions, minimize potential losses, and ensure the stability of our cash flows. By evaluating the models based on various metrics such as AUC-ROC, precision, recall, and F1-score, we can determine which model is best suited for our specific use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this information, we can make data-driven decisions that can help us manage risks effectively and offer competitive prices to our customers while maintaining profitability. The second notebook serves as a comprehensive guide to our model selection process, providing insights that can be leveraged to improve our existing models and build more robust predictive models in the future."
